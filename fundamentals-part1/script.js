// we can store values in variables to use them again and again

// it will create a new variable in a computer's memory and store value in that variable

console.log(fName); //camel case = standard way
let first_name = "Jonathan"; //can also write like this

//cannot start with numbers
// let 3years = 3
// all the errors we make will end up always in console without using console.log().

// let john&harry = 'jh'; cannot use '&'

// variables can only contain letters,numbers,underscore and $ sign.
let john$harry = 'jh';
let john_harry = 'jh';
let j7h8 = 'jh';

// cannot use reserved js keywords
// let new = 27;
// let function = "abc";
// let switch = "abc";

// only 2 symbols allowed besides letters and numbers
let _function = "abc";
let $switch = 4;

// name = a kind of reserved keyword but legal to use = thus, dont use 

// let name = "john";
// console.log(name);

// should not use uppercase also to start a variable name
// convention thus not illegal 
// but used in specific use case like OOP in js
// let Person = "Ram";

// therefore use it like this = lowercase starting
let person = "Ram";

// variables that are fully uppercase are reserved for constants that we know will never change.

// final naming convention = make sure variable names are descriptive (easy to understand what value it holds just by reading a name of variable).

let myFirstPetName = "Tommy";
let myCurrentPetName = "Scotch";

// above is better than below

let pet1 = "Tommy";
let pet2 = "Scotch";
