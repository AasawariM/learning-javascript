// CHALLENGE #3
// There are two gymnastics teams: Dolphins and Koalas. 
// They compete against each other 3 times.
// The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!

// Your tasks:

// 1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data included below. 
// The average score for Dolphins should be assigned to the scoreDolphins variable, 
// and the average score of Koalas should be assigned to the scoreKoalas variable.

// 2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition,
//  and print to the console:
// "Dolphins win the trophy" if Dolphins win, or
// "Koalas win the trophy" if Koalas win, or
// "Both win the trophy" if their average scores are equal.

// Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a
// team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a
// score of at least 100 points.Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum
// score, as well as multiple else -if blocks

// Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when
// both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100
// points.Otherwise, no team wins the trophy


// TEST DATA: 
// Dolphins scored 96, 108, and 89. Koalas scored 88, 91, and 110.

// Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123
// Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106

let scoreDolphins = (96 + 108 + 89) / 3;
let scoreKoalas = (88 + 91 + 110) / 3;
console.log(scoreDolphins);
console.log(scoreKoalas);

if (scoreDolphins > scoreKoalas) {
  console.log("Dolphins win the trophy");
}
else if (scoreDolphins < scoreKoalas) {
  console.log("Koalas win the trophy");
}
// else if (scoreDolphins === scoreKoalas) {
//   console.log("Both win the trophy");
// }
else {
  console.log("Both win the trophy");
}



// BONUS 1 and 2

scoreDolphins = (97 + 112 + 101) / 3;
scoreKoalas = (109 + 95 + 123) / 3;
console.log("Bonus 1:", scoreDolphins, scoreKoalas);


// scoreDolphins = (97 + 112 + 101) / 3;
// scoreKoalas = (109 + 95 + 106) / 3;
// console.log("Bonus 2:", scoreDolphins, scoreKoalas);


if (scoreDolphins > scoreKoalas && scoreDolphins >= 100) {
  console.log("Dolphins win the trophy");
}
else if (scoreDolphins < scoreKoalas && scoreKoalas >= 100) {
  console.log("Koalas win the trophy");
}
else if (scoreDolphins === scoreKoalas && scoreDolphins >= 100 && scoreKoalas >= 100) {
  console.log("Both win the trophy");
}
else {
  console.log("no one wins the trophy");
